/**
 * LOOP asset + home-currency mapping (ADR 015).
 *
 * Single source of truth for:
 *   - the three home currencies Loop supports (USD, GBP, EUR)
 *   - the three LOOP-branded Stellar asset codes that back them
 *     (USDLOOP, GBPLOOP, EURLOOP)
 *   - the 1:1 map between them
 *
 * Backend consumers:
 *   - `db/schema.ts` re-exports `HOME_CURRENCIES` for the
 *     `users.home_currency` CHECK constraint + drizzle enum.
 *   - `credits/payout-asset.ts` re-exports `LoopAssetCode` + the
 *     map; `payoutAssetFor()` stays backend-local because it reads
 *     from `env.ts` for the per-asset Stellar issuer.
 *   - `openapi.ts` / admin handlers use the enum for query-param
 *     validation.
 *
 * Web consumers:
 *   - admin-panel pages (`/admin/payouts`, `/admin/treasury`) use
 *     `LOOP_ASSET_CODES` for filter dropdowns + lookup tables.
 *   - `/settings/wallet` uses `loopAssetForCurrency()` to show the
 *     user which LOOP asset their payouts will arrive as.
 *
 * Why shared: the three-currency ↔ three-asset mapping was
 * duplicated in ~6 places before this slice. If one branch added
 * JPYLOOP and another didn't, every TypeScript callsite that
 * switched on the union would silently accept a "LoopAssetCode"
 * value the schema couldn't store.
